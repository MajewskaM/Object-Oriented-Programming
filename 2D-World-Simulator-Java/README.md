## Gameplay
ðŸŒ± At the start of a game, there appears a window where you can chose board size and its visualization - to be a grid or hexagonal version of a world.
## Examples of Game Saves:
*Java-Saves/save_1* </br>
**Hexagonal World:** Human ability is already activated. </br>
</br>
*Java-Saves/save_2* </br>
**Hexagonal World:** Human ability is deactivated for next 5 rounds.</br>
</br>
*Java-Saves/save_3* </br>
**Grid World:** Situation when human is in the left upper corner of a board, 
his ability is activated (strength is risen to 10) and he is surrounded by two wolves (with strength = 9).
Knowing this information there is no possibility for human to die in this round, he won't get killed by weaker organism.
Next round his strength will be 9 so now he might get killed by one of the wolves as his iniciative is lower (wolves will move before human).
